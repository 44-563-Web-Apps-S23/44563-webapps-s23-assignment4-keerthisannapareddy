            HENRIETTE. What is it? Is it so terribly embarrassing?
        </p>
        <p>
            JACQUES. You can easily guess.
        </p>
        <p>
            JACQUES. I'll risk all at a stroke--My dear Henriette, we are cousins. I
am unmarried, you--a widow. Will you--will you be my wife?
        </p>
        <p>
            HENRIETTE. Oh, my dear Jacques, what _are_ you thinking of? We were such
good friends! And now you're going to be angry.
        </p>
        <p>
            JACQUES. Why?
        </p>
        <p>
            HENRIETTE. Because I'm not going to give you the sort of answer you'd
like.
        </p>
        <p>
            JACQUES. You don't--you don't think I'd make a good husband?
        </p>
        <p>
            HENRIETTE. Frankly, no.
        </p>
