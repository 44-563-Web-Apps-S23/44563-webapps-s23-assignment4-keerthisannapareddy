            <h6>HENRIETTE</h6>
            <p> What is it? Is it so terribly embarrassing?
        </p>
        
           <h6>JACQUES.</h6> 
            <p> You can easily guess.
        </p>
        
            <h6>JACQUES</h6>
            <p>I'll risk all at a stroke--My dear Henriette, we are cousins. I
              am unmarried, you--a widow. Will you--will you be my wife?
        </p>
        
        <h6>HENRIETTE</h6>
            <p>Oh, my dear Jacques, what _are_ you thinking of? We were such
              good friends! And now you're going to be angry.
        </p>
        <h6>JACQUES</h6>
        <p>
            . Why?
        </p>
        <h6>HENRIETTE</h6>
        <p>
            . Because I'm not going to give you the sort of answer you'd
            like.
        </p>
        <h6>JACQUES</h6>
        <p>
             You don't--you don't think I'd make a good husband?
        </p>
        <h6> HENRIETTE</h6>
        <p>
            Frankly, no.
        </p>
        <h6>JACQUES</h6>
          <p>[_Trying to be fair._]</p> <p>I'd trust him with money--I've never
             heard he was a thief.</p>

        <h6>HENRIETTE</h6>   
        <p> But in other ways?</p>
        
        <h6>JACQUES</h6>
        <p> 
            <p>[_Still conscientious._]</p><p>I believe him to be
         somewhat--somewhat----</p>
